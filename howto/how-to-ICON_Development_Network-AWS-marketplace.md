# How to set up "ICON Development Network" on AWS


## Overview
This document is for anyone who wants to set up their own ICON Development Network on AWS.

## Intended Audience
Someone who needs their own "ICON Development Network" for ICON SCORE or DApp.

## Purpose
Following this document step-by-step will all reader to set up their own ICON Development Network on AWS.

## Prerequisites
### Create an Amazon EC2 Key Pair
AWS uses public-key cryptography to secure the login information for your instance. A Linux instance has no password; you use a key pair to log in to your instance securely. You specify the name of the key pair when you launch your instance, then provide the private key when you log in using SSH.
If you haven't created a key pair already, you can create one using the Amazon EC2 console. Note that if you plan to launch instances in multiple regions, you'll need to create a key pair in each region.

1. Sign in to AWS
2. From the AWS dashboard, choose **EC2** to open the Amazon EC2 console.
3. From the navigation bar, select a region for the key pair. You can select any region that's available to you, regardless of your location. However, key pairs are specific to a region; for example, if you plan to launch an instance in the US East (Ohio) Region, you must create a key pair for the instance in the US East (Ohio) Region.
4. In the navigation pane, under **NETWORK & SECURITY**, choose **Key Pairs**.
![Key_Pairs_01](./images/Key_Pairs_01.png)
5. Choose **Create Key Pair**.
6. Enter a name for the new key pair in the **Key pair name** field of the **Create Key Pair** dialog box, and then choose **Create**. Use a name that is easy for you to remember, such as your IAM user name, followed by -key-pair, plus the region name. For example, me-key-pair-useast2.
![Key_Pairs_02](./images/Key_Pairs_02.png)
7. The private key file is automatically downloaded by your browser. The base file name is the name you specified as the name of your key pair, and the file name extension is .pem. Save the private key file in a safe place.
8. If you are using an SSH client on a Mac or Linux computer to connect to your Linux instance, use the following command to set the permissions of your private key file so that only you can read it. If you do not set these permissions, then you cannot connect to your instance using this key pair.
```
chmod 400 my-key-pair.pem
```

### EC2 instance limits

**ICON Development Network** requires at least 7 EC2 instances. However, the default limit is 5 for each region, so you need to request extend EC2 instance limitation. You can request from the link below:
 http://aws.amazon.com/contact-us/ec2-request



## Steps of How-to

### How to deploy on AWS

1. Visit **AWS Marketplace**
https://console.aws.amazon.com/marketplace

![ICON Development Network6](./images/ICON_Development_Network_06.png)
6. The "CloudFormation" screen appears. Select **Next**
![AWS Cloudformation_01](./images/AWS_Cloudformation_01.png)
7. Step "Specify Details"
 - Stack Name: **(Required)** Any stack name (must contain only letters, numbers, dashes and start with an alpha character)
 - Instance Type: ICON EC2 instance type (t2.xlarge, m5.large, m5.xlarge, m5.2xlarge,c5.large, c5.xlarge). Default value is **m5.xlarge**
 - Node Count: ICON Node Cluster size; must be between 4 and 12. Default value is **4**.
 - InstanceName: EC2 Instance Name Prefix. Default value is **"ICON"**.
 - VpcId: **(Required)** VpcId of your existing Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). Select any drop-down menu item.
 - SubnetID: **(Required)** Subnet should be a public subnet. Select largest Subnet id (for example, \*.\*.0.0/32)

![AWS Cloudformation_02](./images/AWS_Cloudformation_02.png)
8. Step "Options". Leave as default. Select **Next**
![AWS Cloudformation_03](./images/AWS_Cloudformation_03.png)
9. Step "Review". Select **Create**
![AWS Cloudformation_04](./images/AWS_Cloudformation_04.png)
10. The setup process is over. Just need to check the **Events** tab below.
![AWS Cloudformation_05](./images/AWS_Cloudformation_05.png)
11. After the network has been deployed successfully using the CloudFormation, you can get information for **ICON Development Network**  from the **Outputs** tab. 
![AWS Cloudformation_06](./images/AWS_Cloudformation_06.png)
12. From **Outputs**, select "LoopChainRadioGroupCheckURL" for peers status.
 - "http://<YourRadiostationIP>:9002/api/v1/peer/list", you can check the information of connected nodes.
![LoopChainRadioGroupCheckURL](./images/LoopChainRadioGroupCheckURL.png)


### EC2 instance connect & navigate
If you want to access each EC2 instance, you need public IP address of each EC2 Instance and private key selected during the CloudFormation process.
Get each EC2 instance Public IP address(**Peer\*PublicIP**) information from Previous **Outputs**

```
$ ssh -i yourkey.pem ec2-user@<Node Instance IP address>
```
You can see various configuration files and start.sh and stop.sh files in ec2-user's home directory.
```
$ ls -l

ICON's services use [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/ "Docker Compose"). You can check the current containers as follows.
```
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                                                             COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES

### Distributing Smart Contract on Reliable Environment (SCORE) using T-bears

T-bears is an ICON SCORE development suite.
The github address is:
https://github.com/icon-project/t-bears

#### Step 1: Installation
Install the T-bears by referring to the following link:
https://github.com/icon-project/t-bears#installation

#### Step 2: Block search & SCORE deploy

T-bears can build an environment that can be deployed in a local SCORE without using the AWS-generated Development Network. See Github for details.

We have already setup ICON Development Network with CloudFormation, we will deal with block search, Send Transaction & Get Transaction Result and SCORE distribution using this network.

##### Block search
Block lookup is possible without any other setting. Use the address of the LoopChainPeer.

###### lastblock
Retrieves the information of the last block in the current blockchain.
```
$ tbears lastblock -u http://<Node Instance IP address>:9000/api/v3

###### Send Transaction & Get Transaction Result
Keystore is needed when sending a transaction or when deploying a SCORE onto the network. You can generate a keystore file using T-Bears CLI.
First, create a keystore.
```
$ tbears keystore <keystorepath>
Input your keystore password:
Retype your keystore password:
Made keystore file successfully
```

When you open the keystore that you just created, you can see that the first keystore address is created in the address field.
```
$ cat <keystorepath>
{"address": "hx4d1042e98770dcbab06ae4b55d09b1215e6d3af8", "crypto": {"cipher": "aes-128-ctr", "cipherparams": {"iv": "2621384865fceeb2988767c64dfe274e"}, "ciphertext": "5505c45ff3dce6742aa4f1630ffbc154b090176716e06942ec67f9bd1549e48b", "kdf": "scrypt", "kdfparams": {"dklen": 32, "n": 16384, "r": 1, "p": 8, "salt": "716a3d1ea83d6e540caeba473bea155d"}, "mac": "a88bc55b881f8b6c74b18b2d73d153bea8d5e178b3d54ae0f500be5e627c0cf1"}, "id": "e1939d52-617e-4a18-96c0-aec1b1cdfbc1", "version": 3, "coinType": "icx"}
```

Before sending the transaction. You need to create a send.json file that contains "from" and "to" information. "from" is the sending address and "to" is the receiving address (you can also use the address of the genesis block that you viewed with the lastblock or blockbyheight, since it is not a commission function because it is a development network).
```
$ vi send.json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "icx_sendTransaction",
  "params": {
    "version": "0x3",
    "from": "hx670e692ffd3d5587c36c3a9d8442f6d2a8fcc795",
    "value": "0x0",
    "stepLimit": "0x3000000",
    "nid": "0x3",
    "nonce": "0x1",
    "to": "hx4d1042e98770dcbab06ae4b55d09b1215e6d3af8",
    "dataType": "call",
    "data": {
      "method": "setValue",
      "params": {
        "value": "0x123"
      }
    }
  },
  "id": 1
}
```
Now, let's send a Transaction.
```
$ tbears sendtx -k <your keystore path> -u http://<Node Instance IP address>:9000/api/v3 send.json
Input your keystore password:
Send transaction request successfully.
transaction hash: 0x2797cd29bd4f56ac82a732cd88d5269ed16739526dd37ccbdd23159c3610a464
```

The confirmation of the sent transaction can be done as follows.
```
$ tbears txresult -u http://<Node Instance IP address>:9000/api/v3 0x2797cd29bd4f56ac82a732cd88d5269ed16739526dd37ccbdd23159c3610a464
Transaction result: {
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "result": {
        "txHash": "0x2797cd29bd4f56ac82a732cd88d5269ed16739526dd37ccbdd23159c3610a464",
        "blockHeight": "0x3",
        "blockHash": "0x9317c73b58a1d2d7838b4b7a40d164bc138c51eacbdaf3198d856b830a8a721f",
        "txIndex": "0x0",
        "to": "hx4d1042e98770dcbab06ae4b55d09b1215e6d3af8",
        "stepUsed": "0xf4a10",
        "stepPrice": "0x0",
        "cumulativeStepUsed": "0xf4a10",
        "eventLogs": [],
        "logsBloom": "0x0000000000........0000000000",
        "status": "0x1"
    },
    "id": 1
}
```

###### SCORE (Smart Contract on Reliable Environment) Deploy

Now that you have a transaction send, let's deploy SCORE.
In T-bears, you can create a basic SCORE. Let's create a SCORE named ABCToken.
```
(work) $ tbears init abc ABCToken
(work) $ ls abc
__init__.py  abc.py  package.json  tests
```
SCORE called ABCToken was created in the abc folder. Now distribute SCORE to the generated Develop Network.
```
$ tbears deploy -u http://<Node Instance IP address>:9000/api/v3 -k <your keystore path> abc
Input your keystore password:
Send deploy request successfully.
If you want to check SCORE deployed successfully, execute txresult command
transaction hash: 0x247ae6cfd8d321420dc93e94d56bdb9e30d8a4c194141f7876ae63f7f995a4db
```
If "Send deploy request successfully" message appears, the distribution was successful. Now, let's check the SCORE address using txresult again with the resulting transaction hash value.

```
$ tbears txresult -u http://<Node Instance IP address>:9000/api/v3 0x247ae6cfd8d321420dc93e94d56bdb9e30d8a4c194141f7876ae63f7f995a4db
Transaction result: {
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "result": {
        "txHash": "0x247ae6cfd8d321420dc93e94d56bdb9e30d8a4c194141f7876ae63f7f995a4db",
        "blockHeight": "0x4",
        "blockHash": "0x6909b8bf9e280ef6f0b059850cd8c42078eeda96825ed38557e9ce74712c2cd4",
        "txIndex": "0x0",
        "to": "cx0000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
        "scoreAddress": "cxe0b089a8b718037c537f877aff52ddb55724df21",
        "stepUsed": "0x12eadf0",
        "stepPrice": "0x0",
        "cumulativeStepUsed": "0x12eadf0",
        "eventLogs": [],
        "logsBloom": "0x0000000000........0000000000",
        "status": "0x1"
    },
    "id": 1
}
```
The scoreAddress value from txresult is the address of the ABCToken that was released earlier. In this example, we can see that it is cxe0b089a8b718037c537f877aff52ddb55724df21.
Now, to check this SCORE API, we check the API of SCORE deployed using scoreapi.
```
$ tbears scoreapi -u http://<Node Instance IP address>:9000/api/v3 cxe0b089a8b718037c537f877aff52ddb55724df21
SCORE API: [

        "name": "fallback",
        "inputs": []
    },
    {
        "type": "function",
        "name": "hello",
        "inputs": [],
        "outputs": [
            {
                "type": "str"
            }
        ],
        "readonly": "0x1"
    }
]
```

You can check the **hello** method of SCORE's API and call it.
First, create a config file called **call.json** and write it like this:

```
$ vi call.json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "icx_call",
  "params": {
    "from": "hx4d1042e98770dcbab06ae4b55d09b1215e6d3af8",
    "to": "cxe0b089a8b718037c537f877aff52ddb55724df21",
    "dataType": "call",
    "data": {
      "method": "hello"
    }
  },
  "id": 1
}
```

"from" is the address of the previously created key, and "to" is the address of the previously SCORE deployed.
The method in the data section means that we will look up the hello method that we just looked up.
Let's call it using this file.
```
$ tbears call -u http://<Node Instance IP address>:9000/api/v3 call.json
response : {
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "result": "Hello",
    "id": 1
}
```
If you get the above results, It is a success.

## Extend the learning
Easy way to check **ICON Development Network** status. - Use Chrome extenstion program ([**POSTMAN**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman/fhbjgbiflinjbdggehcddcbncdddomop?hl=en))

From outputs. Get "LoopChainPeer\*CheckURL"(ex. LoopChainPeer1CheckURL. any LoopChainPeer\*CheckURL) information.
ex) http://ec2-54-180-148-115.ap-northeast-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9000/api/v3
Send below JSON message to LoopchainPeer1CheckURL(POST method)

```
{
      "jsonrpc": "2.0",
      "method": "icx_getLastBlock",
      "id": 1234
}
```

If you receive the following response, "ICON Development Network" status is normal.
